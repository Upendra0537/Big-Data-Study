Hadoop - Framework

HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System - Storage
MapReduce - processess - Map(distributes to all nodes) and reduces(results)
YARN - OS of HADOOP - Yet Another Resource Negotiator


MR-1 - Components
Client
Job Tracker - Master Deamon
Node Tracker - Slave Deamon
HDFS


MR-2 - YARN
Client
Resource Manager - 
Application Manager - Runs the applications of client by taking to Resource manager for resources and Node Manager for execution on the Nodes
Node Manager
HDFS

Files
core-site.xml - localhost Configurations
hdfs-site.xml - Configures Replication factor and HDFS properties
mapred-site.xml - Configures Map reduce framework
yarn-site.xml 


start-all.sh - start all deamon
stop-all.sh - stop all deamon
jps - to check for all deamon status


PIG - Scripting and Programming on Apache Hadoop
	Pig Latin Programming - Mapper and Reduce programs
HIVE - Query and Summarize Data in HDFS
Spark - Programming language for running processess on Hadoop very fast with API

Distributed Platforms
HortonWorks - Supports Windows
Cloudera - 

NoSQL (Not only SQL) Databases
- Key Value - HBase
- Document Oriented - Documents(JASON) and Collections
- Wide Column Family - HBase, Cassandra (combining multiple columns to a single Family Column)
- Graph Databases - Neo4j, TitanDB



HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System - Storage
	NameNode - Metadata of Nodes - Single
	DataNode - Actual Data - Multiple
		Stored as blocks - 128MB
[Upendra]$ ls  -> local file system
[Upendra]$ hdfs ds -ls -> HDFS file System
copy from local to hdfs
[Upendra]$ hdfs dfs -put <filename> /user/xyz/hdfs/
[Upendra]$ hadoop fsck /user/xyz/hdfs - gives the blocks information

NameNode - SPOF(Single Point of Failure)
Solution is to have two NameNode in Active and Passive status. 
Passive namenodes syncs with changes to Active Namenode
QuorumJournalManager - JournalNode have logs of the active NameNode.

NameNode Contains
Editlog - logs all the functions
FsImage - namespace Image(mapping of blocks)


Secondary NameNode - backup of NameNode
