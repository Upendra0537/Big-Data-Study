MetaStore - Schema is stored
	- Embedded - Derby - one session at a time(not suitable for Production)
	- Local Metastore - MySQL
	- Remote Metastore


Execution Process
-> UI/CLI where the Hive query is written and given to driver
-> Drive communicates with Compiler using Metastore and create a plan
-> Plan is shared to the Execution Engine which also uses MetaStore and talks Hadoop for data retrieval

Default Database - metastore_db
case-sensitive

Collections
	- Map - Key,value
	- Struct - object reference
	- Array - index

hive -f <scriptname> - to run a script
